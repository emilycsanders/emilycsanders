# 👋 Hi there, I'm Emily Sanders!

🎓 I'm a Business Analytics and Information Systems student at the University of Iowa, graduating in December 2025. Passionate about data, technology, and turning complex problems into clear solutions, I enjoy working on projects that blend analytics, strategy, and storytelling. 

💡 I believe everything is done with a purpose—from the way we design user experiences to the data we choose to analyze—and I bring that mindset into every project I take on.

💼 Through my education at the University, I've developed skills in:

- 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 🤖 Machine Learning & Forecasting (scikit-learn, ARIMA, TextBlob)
- 🌐 Web Development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
- 🗂️ Business Strategy, Marketing, and HR Insights

🚀 On this GitHub, you'll find a mix of personal projects, classwork, and collaborative consulting work—ranging from predictive models and sentiment analysis to responsive web design.
